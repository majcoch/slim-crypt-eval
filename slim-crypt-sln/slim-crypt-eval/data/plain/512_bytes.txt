Sample data size is 512-bytes. This is a super long sample data plain file. It is used to evaluate encryption algorithms on AVR platform. Please stay tuned for results. Encryption in progres. Results will be avaliable soon. This file is just a simple encryption evaluation data file. Nothing secret in here. Depending on file system this can occupy one or more blocks on disk. For further details on file system please refer to slim-fat library. Once results are available the fastest algorithm will be revealed.
